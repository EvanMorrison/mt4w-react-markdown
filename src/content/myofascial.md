Myofascial Release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves applying gentle sustained pressure into the connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion.

Fascia is a specialized system of the body that is very densely woven connective tissue, covering and interpenetrating every muscle, bone, nerve, artery and vein. Trauma, inflammatory responses, and/or surgical procedures create myofascial restrictions that can produce pressures on pain sensitive structures that do not show up in many of the standard tests. A high percentage of people suffering with pain and/or lack of motion may be having undiagnosed fascial problems.

The relief experienced from Myofascial Release can be incredible, with benefits including dramatically increased mobility, stability, and functional strength.
